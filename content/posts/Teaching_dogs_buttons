We want to gather dog barks and their body language to know what they are saying. Dogs have shown that they can understand different languages and are very similar to infants in understanding language. Dogs have been taught to use buttons to communicate so why canâ€™t we figure out what they are saying. As a dog lover, I know that will make my life so much easier. 

I am always curious how these dogs communicate using the buttons and I was told it is similar to how we use a keyboard on a computer. When I first learned how to type, I learned how to position my hands on the keyboard. So for dogs, it is figuring out how to use the buttons. So they will start with simple cues such as going outside and food. As the dogs are able to master this, the owner will introduce more and more buttons. As more buttons are added the dog remembers where each command is just like we know where all the buttons are on a keyboard. So when you have been typing for a while, you can type and look away. This is exactly how the dogs know how to use the buttons to communicate.

If you have some experience with companies like FluentPet, we would love to hear from you to get feedback.
